    <title>Vancouver Traveller's Guide</title>
    <p>
        Many people have asked me what to do in Vancouver since I go there a lot
        (we spend 6% of each year residing at a hotel in Vancouver over ~9 trips).
        Therefore, I decided to write a guide about it, and I hope it helps.
        <br>
        This guide goes over:
        <ul>
            <li>How to minimize time spent at Border</li>
            <li>How to declare items at the border to prove you're crossing legally</li>
            <li>What to eat at Vancouver</li>
            <li>What to do with your spare time at Vancouver</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

                <summary>Declaring items when returning from Canada</summary>
            </details>
            To reach Vancouver from Seattle you need to cross an international border 
            (if this sounds obvious to you this is meant for users across the world btw).
            <br>
            There are four options:
            <ul>
                <li>Peace Arch (I-5 / BC-99)</li>
                <li>Truck Route (WA-543 / BC-15)</li>
                <li>Lynden Aldergrove (WA-539 / BC-13)</li>
                <li>Summas (WA-9 / BC-11)</li>
                <del>I was going to brag about memorizing the names of all of these until I 
                realized I had confused 3 of these with each other after a quick Wikipedia
                search oops.</del>
            </ul>
            To get to the point, <red>Truck Route</red> is slow because there's a "hack" I am not allowed
            to disclose, and <red>Summas</red> is literally an hour away so you only cross there if you're
            going to Banff.
            <br>
            Therefore, when going <b>to/from</b> Canada, the only crossings you use are <green>Peace Arch</green>
            or <green>Lynden/Aldergrove</green>.

            Search "<a href="https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html">US to Canada Border Crossing time</a>" or "<a href="https://bwt.cbp.gov/index.html">Canada to US border crossing time</a>" to get information on crossing waits. <br>
            Note that Lynden/Aldergrove (right on map) is an extra 20-30 minutes drive excluding border waits, so cross there
            if and only if the line is 20-30 minutes faster there. <br>
            <green>If you do choose to use Lynden/Aldergrove crossing, I strongly recommend taking 0 Ave back to BC-99 as it is right
                on the border and very interesting!
            </green>
            <br>
            If you do not trust the time provided for Peace Arch (it can be wrong by up to 30 minutes), you can do your own measurement!
            Simply go on Google Maps, and see where the <red>red</red> "traffic jam" starts.

            Things are faster when crossing back from Canada as U.S. border patrol is faster.
